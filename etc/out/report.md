To begin our study of music preference, we chose to work with a domain of songs and created a grid using the Repertory Grid Technique, a psychological research method used to elicit personal constructs from individuals. The grid consists of 8 attribute sets, each with 11 elements: PopSong, RockSong, DanceSong, Ballad, AcousticSong, ElectronicSong, HappySong, SadSong, FastSong, SlowSong, LoveSong, HateSong, SoloSong, Collaboration, CatchySong, and BoringSong.

We conducted interviews with a group of participants, asking them to rate each of the 10 songs provided on each attribute set. The songs were selected based on their popularity and familiarity, so we could get more consistent responses across different individuals. The songs we chose were: "Shape of You" by Ed Sheeran, "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen, "Yesterday" by The Beatles, "Tears in Heaven" by Eric Clapton, "Billie Jean" by Michael Jackson, "Stairway to Heaven" by Led Zeppelin, "Enchanted" by Taylor Swift, "It Will Be Fine" by BTS, "Harleys in Hawaii" by Katy Perry, and "It'll Be Okay" by A R I Z O N A.

After collecting the data from the interviews, we analyzed the results and found that certain attribute sets were more strongly associated with certain songs than others. For example, "Shape of You" was consistently rated highly on the PopSong and DanceSong attribute sets, while "Bohemian Rhapsody" was rated highly on the RockSong attribute set. We were able to use these patterns to create clusters of songs that were more closely related based on their ratings, which could be useful for music recommendation systems.

Overall, our study using the Repertory Grid Technique on a domain of songs was successful in identifying attribute associations between songs and individuals. The results can be used to inform music recommendation systems and improve our understanding of how people perceive and categorize music.
